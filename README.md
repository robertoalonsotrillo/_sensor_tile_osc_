# _sensor_tile_osc_

Bridging app developed by **Paulo Esteban Chiliguano** and **Roberto Alonso Trillo** for HKBU's Department of Music.

This python-based bridging app addressses the issues with BLE connectivity (low energy Bluetooth) that we found between the SensorTile/Metaboard©  and MaxMSP and Touchdesigner. It takes the data sent through a BLE signal from a Sensor Tile or Metaboard and outputs an OSC formatted data array to Max or Touchdesigner. The App has been integrated into the Metabow Toolkit described below but it might be used with any other OSC receiving software environment.
